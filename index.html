        <h3>Wizard vs Witch Rules
            <br>• The wizard is fighting the witch until either player wins by depleting the opponents health
            <br> Both players start with five health
            <br> If a player loses a round their health goes down by one
            <br>The Wizard always goes first
            <br> The Computer is the Witch
            <br> During each players turn they have the option to either Attack, Shield, or Absorb
            <br> ----- If a player chooses attack
            <br>They draw if the opponent attacks
            <br> They lose if the opponent shields
            <br> They win if the opponent absorbs
            <br> ----- If a player chooses shield
            <br> They draw if the opponent shields
            <br> They lose if the opponent absorbs
            <br> They win if the opponent attacks
            <br> ----- If the player chooses absorb
            <br> They draw if the opponent absorbs
            <br>They lose if the opponent attacks
            <br>They win if the opponent shields
            <br>Each round continues in succession until a player wins
